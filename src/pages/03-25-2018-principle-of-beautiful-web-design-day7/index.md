Step 1 in designing a page is to make its wireframes (or layout up to your call). I don't know there are any special details that we need to pay attention. However in order to create harmony among different parts of the page, the author utilize his artistic sense which is by no mean easily to acquire.

Step 2 is the color. Now between all text in this blog, I would share a deep and dark secret that I am never a good colorman. I used to be a good kid in an art class mostly because I was good at drawing shapes and landscapes. But they all turned to be horrible when they had got colors from me. Perhaps this is an opportunity to fix this broken part in me.
