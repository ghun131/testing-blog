1. First day on Chapter 2, I make the Battleships game. To start, I need to code a simple version of 7 consecutive boxes and only one box that has the ship. It look like this. (It was my misunderstanding because the ship is located in three consecutive boxes. Later there were more details that clarify this.)

So they break down details of the game for me which is nice because if I am left with this task, it might be quite messy. Next, they help me to construct pseudo-code. Now I know it is a good habit to write pseudo-code prior to actually type anything into my IDE (or console) but from time to time I forget it. Another strength of this method is using paper and pen and it helps a lot because I am not much into staring at the laptop screen.

Wow I have known JS for 4 months but still I am not accustomed with logic blocks! What a disappointment! Anyway I figured out the logic but wasn't confident enough so finally copy their code. Ultimately they use the logic that I intend to write. Once again self-assurance ditches me for oblivion.



After the first day, this article had been left for 3 days without any updates.



0. There are important concepts from chapter 1 not in here so I want to emphasize on a few key points. Firstly the definition of expression and statement. Then block of code is also something that I need to pay attention.

A **statement** is an instruction for the computer to execute.

**Expression** evaluate to values

A **block of code** (or a block) is a set of statements varying from one statement or many statements between the curly braces.
