#Key things acquire from this project:

1. I can use JQuery to change CSS
2. There are as many JQuery methods as JavaScript methods or HTML
3. The background pictures visualization is not stable. Most of the time they disappear

I won't show any final product in here since I only have 1GB free disk space in GithubPages.
