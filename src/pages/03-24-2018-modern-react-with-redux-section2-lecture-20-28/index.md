title: "Mordern React with Redux Section 2 Lecture 29-33"

In these videos, I learn to pass data around with props. But from time to time I still ask myself why React needs to have instances every time we want to pass something to its. At first I think these kind of things only occur with class base component but then function base component behaves the same way so I guess it is some sort of React mystery. (or I can go back to Lecture 10 Section 1).

With a list of item react need a key for each item.

I got a problem with the screen when they are in different sizes. Things in there are crammed when it is a big screen and become better with smaller screen. I wrote about this in here:

I tends to be forgetful sometimes so I need to remind myself that the main reason I write this blog is to explain code for myself. Therefore, no question should be left unasked and I should not be hesitate to speak my mind. So these are few things that bother me:

![First bothering thing](http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354607/bother1.jpg)

In the code above, what are **video-list media**, **media-left** and **media-heading**? And **why do we need those things?** They are not explained in the docs of Bootstrap 4 is one thing but Stephen don't tell me about is another thing. (*Well actually he has the Q&A section but I will do it later*). Then I have this one.

![Second bothering thing](http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354607/bother2.jpg)

Despite of reading these things in the Boostrap 4 docs, I still don't get used to it (*This is just me, my stupidity and my personality. May want to work on that!*) and come to term with it. And then:

![Third thing that bothers me](http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354606/bother3.jpg)

How the heck he know that the url will return a video. (*Unlike you Hung! Stephen must have studied very detailed about youtube api. And actually this is a chance for you to learn so don't be such a ass like that*).

![Number four](http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354607/bother4.jpg)

Again! **How did he know this syntax to access Youtube api?** (*Again! Did you read the docs Hung?*)

![Last thing](http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354607/bother5.jpg)

**How did he come up with the idea of constructing this object?**

I will have to answer these questions if I want to understand React better. That might not be an issue if I had a photographic memory and a stronger brain but I should do what I can.
