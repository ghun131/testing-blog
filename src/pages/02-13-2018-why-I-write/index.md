title: "Why I write?"
---

As much as I regret not to record my thoughts and questions about any previous projects that I had worked on, I would love to fix it by starting this blog.

There are two key reasons here for me: First of all, I like to write in English. Secondly, writing down my thoughts would help my learning process since I believe that whatever can be understood can also be clearly explained.

This blog will be written in the succinct style but also must be comprehensible for its only audience (me) because how I can reflect my thoughts without understanding them in the first place.
