Continue with my marathon!

Some questions that come to mind during the video sessions:
1. Okay so what is it with the `children` property, I don't think for now I can use it comfortably. I met this issue at the chapter Debugging React App video 74. Just note it down here in case I want to come back to it.
2. Breaking the UI into components is something I thought that can be easily understood but after the lesson of video 79, I believe that I have changed my mind. Each component should have a **clear, specific and narrow** responsiblity. The **container component needs to be as lean as possible** and it is a good practice to use **as many functional component** as I can.
3. React Life Circle is something that is tremendously tedious and it bores the hell out of me so just to remind myself about these important but dull technical knowledge, I am going to add a few key words because I know I will need to look back at them in the future:
- `shouldComponentUpdate` is fucking confusing but it is said that this method is very useful.
- There are two life circles here updates from outside by **Props changes** and updates from inside because of `setState()`
