###What I have learnt so far:

1. What is jsonp? Why do I use jsonp instead of json? *Reading this after 4 months, I come to think that knowing jsonp do me no good. Well truth is I know the keyword but I'm not sorry what to make use of it for now. I can't confidently say that I remember its definition.*
2. Why do I need $.ajax? What the difference between it and $getJSON? *Forget this one too*
3. I should know how to use SASS. *Yeah I kind of get it now*
4. How to make a Twitter button. *Button is no longer something very intimidating with me even I use Pure CSS*s
