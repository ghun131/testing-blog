**How I feel**

It's pretty hard. I can only do about 15% of the test and I don't even confident with my answers. I sure felt little embarassed with my performance although I don't think many people who participated in that test were different.
Some part of me felt delightful because there are many useful things that I can learn. Then what are they:

**Things I can learn**
- Polimorphism, serialisation, overloading
- C, SQL maybe Java syntax (why java?)
- Pointer, stack
- Class and inheritance
- Prefix, infix, postfix
- relational algebra
- Tuples?
