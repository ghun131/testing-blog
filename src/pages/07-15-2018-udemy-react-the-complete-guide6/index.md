This morning was rough, but now I am in a place to learn so it is better.

1. I have one question: **Why do we put `AUTH TOKEN` into the `headers`**? This is what happen in chapter 9 video 156.

2. I just finish building the skeleton for **Random Quote Machine** by using React but I can't believe the most fearsome ordeal that I have been through is the structure of the link. By missing only one "?", my entire `url` doens't work.
