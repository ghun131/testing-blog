After having a good conversation with my friend Trung, I learn quite a lot of things and I think I'm gonna start this small project.

By using the mobile first approach, the layout of my page would be the first priority. However that is just an epiphany about the styling aspect of the page. What I desperately need now is to make my self accustomed with the working process of making an React app.

I try to implement **stateless** writing style in this simple app.

I need to insert React Bootstrap CDN into the html file in order to make it work. Obviously installing this dependency by using yarn is not enough.

One lesson I learn when working on this small toy is about data structure and how to pass them around.
