2. To be fair this is the second day I have spent on this chapter and they knowledge about array is not something new to me. What intrigue me the most is about how smooth it is for me to write some basic logic for the functions.

It was hardly noticeable since my code worked the same with it had worked in the "functionless" style and the same result is delivered.
