1. My first intention is to deploy an app on Heroku and learn how to use it in the process. But then after 1 hour of research, I figure out that I need a programming language other than JavaScript to deploy on Heroku so perhaps I should use free static web platform by Github Pages.

Ok now I resolve to using the Github Pages, it doesn't have a nice URL but I guess it is much easy to deploy a simple page. In the future when I have more badges on my belt, I will consider changing it or even rent a host. Who knows?

First of all, I need to create my page on my machine. Actually if my memory is correct, then I should already have one on my Codepen. I will just download and modify it. Let's see how terrible I used to be.

2. Second day! Finish the skeleton of the portfolio.

3. I am styling my page. Even it was intended to be a static web, I will make some simple effect like if people shrink the window or open the page in mobile or tablet window, some parts of my page will change. Another thing is the scrolling effect. It is when you click a category in the navigation bar, it will slide downward slowly.

Ok so after today I have learnt one thing:

- How to make smooth scroll with JQuery. (I doubt that I will remember it tomorrow because I don't think I understand a thing but hell I make it work).

4. Day 4! I deploy it on GitHub Pages as a static website even though it has an effect named smooth scroll (Yeah I know it's pathetic but come on! This's all I can do). Anyway it looks nice and I think it's feel nice. Hopefully in the next 6 months when I am coming back to it, I will look at it with much contempt because I'm gonna be a lot better than I am now. Any way, it's another baby step for you Hung!
