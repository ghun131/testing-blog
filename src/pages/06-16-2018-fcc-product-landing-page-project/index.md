### fCC: Product landing page note

This time it only took me one day to finish this simple page. Everything was a little bit more in place. I wrote the html first, read the user stories while doing so and at the same time tried to by mindful about id names or class names. Now this landing page is only about 150 lines of html and about 200 lines of css. Here are somethings that bother me:

1. My effort of structuring the css hasn't borne any fruit. The 200 lines is just a small mess for one page but if it was 2000 lines, it would become a chore to go through all of them
2. The unit test that is written by fCC for us learners doesn't work properly. I would admit that I peeked at the sample code and that was kind of cheating. But eventually my code does look quite simlar. Anyway it just wasn't passed.
3. While working on the web, I only worried about whether it responsive or not but I couldn't cover its cross-browser compatibility and maintenance. So I think I'm going to tackle the cross-browser thing with sass and hopefully I will find some good design pattern for css
