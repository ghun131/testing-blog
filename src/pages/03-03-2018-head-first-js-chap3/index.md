1. This is the second day I am on this book. All the concepts that they introduce aren't strangers to me but going through it once again helps with my understanding of many fundamentals.

So it is about the functions. There are two types of functions: built-in functions and declared functions. Function contains parameters and if a function is called, its parameters are arguments. I have been using functions for as long as I code JavaScript but now it is the first time I get it. It is definitely a revelation. I'll come back to it later tomorrow!

2. Global and local variables are important components of JavaScript. After a chat with my friend, I figure out that not only parameters of functions are pass-by-value but also other things (and I can't state clearly what those things are thanks to my poor memory. Good job! Hung). It actually reminds me of some concept of mutable and immutable objects but for now I don't think I have good grasp of these concepts. Anyway back to JS. So this part is about how to write clean codes with local and global variables.
