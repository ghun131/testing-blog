So I start this course in order to quickly improve my React skills for the Hackathon. First video doesn't impress me much. The instructor accent proves that he is not very much a English native speaker.

The first part is quick introduction about ES6 syntax. So basically they are:
>let
>const
>Fat arrow function
>Export and import
>Classes
>Classes properties and methods
>Spread and Rest operator (but basically just "free dots")
>Destructuring (still "free dots")
>Reference and Primitive type (change mutable value into immutable value so things are seperated).
