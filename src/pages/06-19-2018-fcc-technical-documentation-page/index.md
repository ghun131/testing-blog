### fCC: Technical Documentation Page note

So I have finished the HTML part of this exercise and I want to come here to lament about the **lengthy HTML content** that took away two hours of my life. It would have been worse if I hadn't had the choice of copy-paste. It's a real nuisance that bothers me to no end. Thankfully there was no student around when I was doing all the hand-typing muscle-demanding content input task. I was cursing like a sailor the whole process and there is no pride in losing my temper. I imagine people should have come up with some sort of solution for things like this.

I have embarked on a journey of learning SASS which till now not too challenging to me. Perhaps I have been ignorant about its wide application in the industry and the first statement seems like arrogant. It's such a blessing not to know how deep and how difficult it would have been and I don't know whether it is intentional for its creator to make it so approachable for someone at the layman level like me. Well at least I don't say that compiling it is easy since it took me some time to figure it out.

After two days of working, I have finished this project without flying color. (LOL! Just kidding). Some remarks I should make along the way:

1. Unit test is tough. Sometimes I need to meet an User Story in a very specific case which is bothersome because I tend to loosely clone those web. Maybe it is a bad habit but I think it help me get things done faster.
2. I only have one `@media` query.
3. I have a chance to style code block in an document which is all cool because things like `white-space`, `word-break` and `word-wrap`.
4. Hah I use some SASS in my project. Now I can totally brag about this skill and put it into my resume (Well I shouldn't get this excited because it is just a pre-processor after all but I just can't help myself). Well the best of me attempt to use variable and that's it. I failed to exploit many other functionality of SASS. To my defend, I would say that my css file is rather small and I don't want to overkill it.
