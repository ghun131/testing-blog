So it has been almost a month since the last update. Well I guess it's time to ramble about how annoying of a situation that I'm in. After such quite long time, I now can't really remember where I am in that entire work flow. It's really interesting that I ask myself questions like **What has been happening?** and **What have I done the entire time?**. Okay those questions now can be quite tormenting so I'm going to move to a more productive one now which is **What should I do?**

It seems the obvious answer is to pick up what I left from this course which is quite difficult. I don't really know where to start. Maybe go back to the text in this blog. Well I can read all the written code here. It sounds very reasonable but a lot of work would be involved. What's a drag! Or

I can keep pushing forward with where I stand now which is React Router. I admit that it becomes really tedious. Maybe I give it another chance.
