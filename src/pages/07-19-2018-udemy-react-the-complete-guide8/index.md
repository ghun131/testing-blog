My friend told me that I would need at least two day to finish chapter 8. Let's see how accurate her statement is.

1. The first nuisance that I encounter is in video 112 of this chapter. They use an `_` in the `map()` function which represent for the empty value that we don't care.
2. Let's assume that every he has done is correct and it actually is, then how on Earth did he come up with this idea of doing things. **The answer should be pretty much in the things that he has said**. 
*You should watch this video more carefully*
3. But do I understand the role of `PropTypes` that I installed. The advice here is to read its docs. Well but the best guess I can make out of this is that `PropTypes` helps to link the property `type` with a certain value that we've already assigned somewhere in our app.
