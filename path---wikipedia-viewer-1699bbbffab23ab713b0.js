The random article part is super easy. Just HTML and I am ready to go but the search bar is so hard.</p>\n<p>I can pretty much make the search bar appear in my browser but it is much harder to make it works.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What I need to do is to make the API call when the input box is filled with words. Firstly, I need to find that url of the API which seems to be hard because of the complexity of Wiki API. To be honest, I don't understand a thing. Well I have a sand box to experiment with the requests that would be triggered by clicking the search button. But how do I find the right action?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>I'm going to bed now! It's been second day that I've  got stuck with this and there is no improvement so far. But tomorrow I need to remember that my issues right now are:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Make the api call</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Know how to send data to the API when a search term is typed into the input form</em>\n<em>These tasks seem brief and simple but it by no mean is like that. Remember that I found 1 Youtube tutorial and 2 others from Medium. One discussion on Reddit is also very helpful. Dig into them tomorrow.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is day 3 for this small project which is much harder than anticipated. I come to think that unlike the Random Quote API or Local Weather API, the Wiki API is fucking massive that supports different programming languages and multiple actions, functions and some absolutely obscure stuff to me. It's obvious time to experiment with the code from multiple articles and tutorials.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's annoying after getting stuck for a while so I guess I will go with the tutorial videos. <strong>When it is finished, I am definitely going to learn some more about how to make API call.</strong> Things like: action, API keys, token etc. are such pain in the neck especially when I don't know how to do it.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>This is the fourth day on this challenge. What I have learnt so far is that I am quite sucked at reading <strong>documentation of the API</strong> (Might need to work on that later). Ha! I also know how to manipulate HTML by using <strong>append</strong> or <strong>prepend</strong> methods (and there are a lot of quotation marks that it hurts my eyes to look at)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyway it's time to style the app since I believe that I finish building the skeleton. I will go with <em>DuckDuckGo design.</em></p>\n<p>The asterisk (*) symbol in CSS is to select everything and z-index is used to stack things. Things that have higher z-index value will be in front of things that have lower value. (Hey this is the message for future Hung, remember that and style your pages properly. Won't you?)</p>",frontmatter:{date:"February 14, 2018",path:"/wikipedia-viewer",title:"Wiki Viewer thoughts note"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
