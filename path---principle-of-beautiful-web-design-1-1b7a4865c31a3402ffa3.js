I will try to update what I have read about it and my interpretation of its content.</p>\n<p>First chapter is about Layout and Composition. It introduces The Design Process in which the first step would be Discovery. In this step we are going to find out the most about the clients, their situations and their needs. Important questions are asked. Point taken here is that meeting with the clients should be in person and try to avoid tech devices (because of their distraction effects and a pad for writing is good enough, don\'t record them via a voice recorder). The meeting is important but shouldn\'t be too serious or formal, it is ideal for a meeting a caf√© after lunch. I learn the term "comp" means "comprehensive dummy" which is used as a simulation before the real prints.</p>\n<p>The next step would be Exploration. Well to me these two words even sounds differently but they seem to ring the same bell in my head. However, the authors elaborate different things between those two stages. Exploration is somewhat internal (in your team) to dissect and to analyze the information about clients. The term "information architecture" (IA) comes up. Using sticky notes and white board to understand the organizing of content, its flow then designer will propose a structure to design around. Information should be relevant and easy to reach.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"March 10, 2018",path:"/principle-of-beautiful-web-design1",title:"Principle of Beautiful Web Design day 1"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
