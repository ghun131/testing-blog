But from time to time I still ask myself why React needs to have instances every time we want to pass something to its. At first I think these kind of things only occur with class base component but then function base component behaves the same way so I guess it is some sort of React mystery. (or I can go back to Lecture 10 Section 1).</p>\n<p>With a list of item react need a key for each item.</p>\n<p>I got a problem with the screen when they are in different sizes. Things in there are crammed when it is a big screen and become better with smaller screen. I wrote about this in here:</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp-Hanoi/learn-react-udemy/issues/8">https://github.com/freeCodeCamp-Hanoi/learn-react-udemy/issues/8</a></p>\n<p>I tends to be forgetful sometimes so I need to remind myself that the main reason I write this blog is to explain code for myself. Therefore, no question should be left unasked and I should not be hesitate to speak my mind. So these are few things that bother me:</p>\n<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354607/bother1.jpg" alt="First bothering thing"></p>\n<p>In the code above, what are <strong>video-list media</strong>, <strong>media-left</strong> and <strong>media-heading</strong>? And <strong>why do we need those things?</strong> They are not explained in the docs of Bootstrap 4 is one thing but Stephen don\'t tell me about is another thing. (<em>Well actually he has the Q&#x26;A section but I will do it later</em>). Then I have this one.</p>\n<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354607/bother2.jpg" alt="Second bothering thing"></p>\n<p>Despite of reading these things in the Boostrap 4 docs, I still don\'t get used to it (<em>This is just me, my stupidity and my personality. May want to work on that!</em>) and come to term with it. And then:</p>\n<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354606/bother3.jpg" alt="Third thing that bothers me"></p>\n<p>How the heck he know that the url will return a video. (<em>Unlike you Hung! Stephen must have studied very detailed about youtube api. And actually this is a chance for you to learn so don\'t be such a ass like that</em>).</p>\n<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354607/bother4.jpg" alt="Number four"></p>\n<p>Again! <strong>How did he know this syntax to access Youtube api?</strong> (<em>Again! Did you read the docs Hung?</em>)</p>\n<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hunghayho131/image/upload/v1530354607/bother5.jpg" alt="Last thing"></p>\n<p><strong>How did he come up with the idea of constructing this object?</strong></p>\n<p>I will have to answer these questions if I want to understand React better. That might not be an issue if I had a photographic memory and a stronger brain but I should do what I can.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"March 25, 2018",path:"/modern-react-with-redux-section2-lecture-29-33",title:"Mordern React with Redux Section 2 Lecture 29-33"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
