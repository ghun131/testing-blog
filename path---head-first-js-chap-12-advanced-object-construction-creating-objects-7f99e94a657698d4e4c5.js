It takes parameters and can be reused like function while having "this" in it and contains properties and methods. Unlike its father - function, its name is capitalized for the first letter and unlike its mother - object, it doesn\'t use comma. I can provide an example of object constructor from the book. It goes like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">function Coffee(roast, ounces) {\n    this.roast = roast;\n    this.ounces = ounces;\n    this.getSize = function() {\n        if (this.ounces === 8) {\n            return "small";\n        } else if (this.ounces === 12) {\n            return "medium";\n        } else {\n            return "large";\n        }\n    };\n    this.toString = function () {\n        console.log("You\'ve ordered a " + this.getSize() + " " + this.roast + " coffee.");\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think its look is quite balanced with 2 properties (roast and ounces) and two methods (<code>getSize</code> and <code>toString</code>). Now let see how it create objects:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">var houseBlend = new Coffee("House Blend", 12);\nvar darkRoast = new Coffee("Dark Roast", 16);\n</code></pre>\n<p>It has keyword <strong>new</strong> which is really new to me (because I had thought that it would have been invoked like a normal function.). Come to know of it, <strong>new</strong> is a operator (like +, -, +=, === etc.) that would work only with function (as far as I know). An interesting detail is that <strong>new</strong> is the one who create object not the constructor.</p>\n<h3>2</h3>\n<p>Something quite annoying has happened today about object contructor. Let say I have one like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">function Car(make, model, year, color, passenger, convertible, mileage, started) {\n            this.make = make;\n            this.model = model;\n            this.year = year;\n            this.color = color;\n            this.passenger = passenger;\n            this.convertible = convertible;\n            this.mileage = mileage;\n            this.started = started;\n            this.start = function () {\n                this.started = true;\n            }\n            this.stop = function () {\n                this.started = false;\n            }\n            this.drive = function () {\n                if (this.started) {\n                    return this.make + " goes zoom zoom!";\n                } else {\n                    return "Start the engine first!";\n                }\n            }\n        };\n</code></pre>\n<p>That many parameters may one day get me into big trouble with hard-to-find bugs. So they propose a way to refactor this constructor for easier use:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">function Car(params) {\n    this.make = params.make;\n    this.model = params.model;\n    this.year = params.year;\n    this.color = params.color;\n    this.passengers = params.passengers;\n    this.convertible = params.convertible;\n    this.mileage = params.mileage;\n    this.started = params.started;\n    this.start = function() {\n        this.started = true;\n    }\n    this.stop = function() {\n        this.started = false;\n    }\n    this.drive = function() {\n        if (this.started) {\n            console.log(this.make + " " + this.model + " goes zoom zoom!");\n        } else {\n            console.log("Start the engine first.");\n        }\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>and now each time I want to create a new object, just make one object literal and pass it into the constructor. Something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">var cadiParams = {make: "GM",\n                model: "Cadillac",\n                year: 1955,\n                color: "tan",\n                passengers: 5,\n                convertible: false,\n                mileage: 12892};\n\nvar cadi = new Car(cadiParams);\n</code></pre>\n<p>So basically, apart from the methods, I need to hand-write most of the properties much like declaring object literals. Such a half-baked solution! Can\'t believe I was rejoiced when I had learned about object constructor at the beginning of this chapter.\nBtw, this chapter introduces the book "<em>JavaScript the definitive guide</em>" which is about roughly 1100 pages and if I want to learn more about JS built-in object, this one is definitely a good choice.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"May 08, 2018",path:"/head-first-js-chap12-advanced-object-construction-creating-objects",title:"Head first JS Chap 12: Advanced Object Construction: Creating objects"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
